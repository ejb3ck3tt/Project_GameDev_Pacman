# About the Pacman Project

This project is one of my uni project where I have to recreate pacman using p5.js.

# How to run the project

- install "Live server" extension in VS code
- clone the repository
- run index.html file to your browser via live server (right mouse click on index.html and select open with live server...)

<strong>If you encounter CORS issue... you can run the project via express js.</strong>

- on the root directory, run npm install.
- after installing the node_modules. On terminal, run:
  <code>node server.js</code>

then open localhost http://localhost:3000/ on your browser.
